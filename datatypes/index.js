/* In computing, data is information that has been translated into a form that's efficient for processing 

JavaScript has 8 different data types for processing. These are:

undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigent, number, object

When you declare a variable in JavaScript, you specify the data type and you store the value.
In order to create a variable in JavaScript, we use the keyword var.

a string: stores a series of characters with quotations: single '' or double ""
a number: any whole number

// Code examples
// String example:
var hello = "Welcome!";
var goodbye = "Peace out!"
// JavaScript method called console log to print data
// semi-colon ; is used to end an expression.
console.log(hello);
console.log(hello, goodbye);

/* Exercise: Declare a variable as a number and set it to the number 5 then console log the variable
and check that the output equals 5 */

var number = 5;
console.log("Solution", number);
